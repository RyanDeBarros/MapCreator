# MapCreator
Similar application to conglomerator, but specialized for tiled map creation.
Created by Ryan de Barros.

## Short description
MapCreator allows for easy creation of tiled maps, i.e., images composed of a grid of same-sized square images (tiles). For now, the tiles must be 64x64 pixels, but I plan to allow control over the tile size in the future. Buttons and spinners can be used, or key bindings which are displayed on screen to insert images, move images, stack tiles, copy/paste templates, and preview the conglomerated image.
